Speaker1 Good morning. What can I do for you, sir?
Speaker0 Good morning. Umm.. I'd like to have a haircut.
Speaker1 Very well. Please sit down here. Do you want me to cut your hair very close?
Speaker0 Please cut the sides shorter, but not so much at the back.
Speaker1 It's such a hot season, isn't it? May I suggest thinning out the top?
