Speaker1 Do you want to go out for dinner tonight?
Speaker0 Sure. Umm have you got anywhere in mind?
Speaker1 I'm starving, so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions.
Speaker0 That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions. Do you want to go there?
Speaker1 I'm not really in the mood for Italian, actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy.
